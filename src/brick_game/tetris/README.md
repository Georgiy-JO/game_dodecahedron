## General

The part of the project in this folder is The Te-Tris game implementation library. That is in fact my version of the Tetris game. GUI and terminal UI version are located in */src/gui* folder.

### Histor 
#### BrickGame

BrickGame is a popular handheld console from the 90s with several ~~thousands~~ of built-in games developed in China. Originally, it was a copy of Tetris, developed in the USSR and released by Nintendo as part of the GameBoy platform, but also included many other games that were added over time. The console had a small screen with a 10x20 size playing field, which was a matrix of "pixels". There was a scoreboard to the right of the field with a digital display of the current game status, records and other additional information. The most popular games on BrickGame were Tetris, Tanks, Racing, Frogger, and Snake.

#### Tetris

Tetris was created on an Electronica-60 computer by Alexey Pajitnov on June 6, 1984. The game was a puzzle based on the use of "tetraminoes" - shaped pieces consisting of four squares. The first commercial version of the game was released in America in 1987. In the following years, Tetris was ported to many devices, including cell phones, calculators, and PDAs.

The most popular version of Tetris is the one for the Game Boy and NES consoles. But there are various versions of the game apart from it. For example, there's a version with three-dimensional pieces or a dueling version where two players get the same pieces and try to beat each other on points.

## Theory

Tetris is probably one of the most popular games for the Brickgame console. It's not rare for the console itself to be referred to as Tetris. The goal of the game is to score points for building lines from the blocks generated by the game. The next block generated by the game starts moving down the playing field until it reaches the lower boundary or collides with another block. The user can rotate the pieces and move them horizontally, trying to make rows. Once filled, the row is destroyed, the player gets points, and the blocks above the filled row go down. The game ends when the next piece stops in the topmost row.
