# Finite-state machine

A finite-state machine (FSM) in the theory of algorithms is a mathematical abstraction, a model of a discrete device that has **one entry**, **one exit** and at each moment of time is in one state out of a set of possible states.

During operation, the input of the FSM sequentially receives entry actions, and at the output the FSM generates exit signals. Transition from one internal state to another can occur not only from external action, but also spontaneously.

FSM can be used to describe algorithms for solving certain problems, as well as for modeling almost any process. A few examples:

- Artificial intelligence logic for games;
- Syntactic and lexical analysis;
- Complex application network protocols;
- Streaming data
